Donald Knuth: computer science is essentially the study of algorithms.
To find a solution to a problem, we can consider three important points:
1- Understanding the problem deeply
2- Creating a plan (or map) for how to solve the problem
3- Analyzing the problem and its solution

1- Understanding the problem:
1.1 Data: the given information or inputs we have, and the results we can get from them.
1.2 Unknown (Majhol): the value or result the problem is asking us to find.
1.3 Connection between data and unknowns: the logical relationship that helps us use the data to find the unknowns.

For example: we want to find a number between 10 and 20.
Data: the two numbers (10, 20)
Unknown: the number between them
Connection: the formula or rule that defines how to get a number between 10 and 20.

Finding the approach: after understanding the problem, the second step is to find a solution.
We can find two types of solutions:
1. With an algorithm
2. Without an algorithm (theoretical or direct way)

Example 2: Suppose there are 20 chess players in a tournament. Each match eliminates one player.
Determine how many matches are played in total.

Data: 20 players
Unknown: total number of matches played

Non-algorithmic approach: in every chess match, there is one winner and one loser.
Since there are 20 participants and only one winner remains at the end,
that means 19 players must have been eliminated.
Therefore, 19 matches were played in total.

Algorithmic approach: the total number of matches equals the number of players minus one.
So, total matches = 20 - 1 = 19.

So what is an algorithm?
Abu Musa al-Khwarizmi: the way he solved problems was called “al-Khwarizmi,”
and later, this word became “algorithm.”
An algorithm is a set of ordered and well-defined steps that solve a problem.

Advantages of an algorithm:
1. The number of steps is finite and known.
2. It has a clear starting point and ending point.
3. Each step is unambiguous (no confusion or vagueness).
4. Each step is understandable and executable.
5. Every step has a specific purpose.

Algorithm from the machine’s point of view:
1. Receiving some data (input)
2. Producing one or more results (output)
3. Performing comparison operations between data
4. Storing data and information in memory
5. Performing mathematical or logical operations

Note:
For two data values, we always have these cases:
a < b   a > b   a = b

For one data value, we have these cases:
a = 0   a < 0   a > 0

- Natural numbers: infinite set that starts from 1 and goes to infinity. Denoted by (N).

- Integers: infinite set that extends in both directions, positive and negative, and includes 0 as the center. Denoted by (Z).

- Rational numbers: infinite set where each number can be written as a fraction (numerator and denominator are integers, and the denominator is not equal to 0). Denoted by (Q).

- Real numbers: infinite set that includes natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers (such as roots or π). Denoted by (R).


- Function (Tabe):  
Assume A and B are two sets.  
Every relationship that connects each element of set A with exactly one element of set B is called a **function from A to B**.  
It is written as:  
f: A → B



- Integer part function (Tabe Juz Saheh):  
It is a function from the set of real numbers (R) to the set of integers (Z).  
Each real number is related to the **greatest integer less than or equal to it**.  
It is written as:  
f: R → Z


exmaple:
[2.3]=2   ,[2]=2  ,[-1]=-1

- Division:
Assume a and b belong to the set of integers (Z) and b ≠ 0.

a = dividend (maqsoom)
b = divisor (maqsoom alayh)
q = quotient (kharij qesmat)
r = remainder (baghimandeh)

So, a, b, q, r ∈ Z

exmaple:Find the quotient and remainder of 15 divided by 4.
15 ÷ 4 = 3.75
So,

Quotient (q) = 3
Remainder (r) = 15 − (4 × 3) = 3

Therefore:15 = 4 × 3 + 3

Note:
Always remember that these divisions are defined in the set of integers (Z), not in the real numbers (R).  
For example, the result of 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5 is not correct here,  
because 0.5 does not belong to Z (the set of integers).
