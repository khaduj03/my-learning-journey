------Descriptive Questions----------

1.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name three important factors for solving a problem and briefly explain each one.
    1- we must understand very deep the problem
    2- we should create plan to solve it!
    3- and Analyzing the problem

explaination:
1-Look at the problem carefully. Know what data you have and what result you need.
2-Think about the steps needed to solve the problem. Decide how to go from the given data to the answer.
3-Figure out how to find the unknowns using the data you have. Break the problem into smaller parts if needed.


2.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Take question 1 and apply it to a simple problem, then explain the different steps to solve it.

for example : write an algorithm that takes A,B,C numbers and give the avarge
so we start the first step  is it gave us three number and our data is A , B , C 
and it want from us the avarge means our Unknown is the avarge

the second step creating plan :

1. start
2. get the A , B , c
3. S ← A + B + C div 3
4. print S
5. end

the thirdht step is and Analyzing the algorithm:

| A | B | C | avarge  |
| 2 | 5 | 5 |2+5+5/3=4|

the result is our Unknown (avarge)=4


3.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Define logical thinking and illogical thinking.
- logical :Understanding the problem, breaking it into small steps, and finding the unknown correctly.
- illogical :Guessing the answer without thinking carefully or using steps.


4.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Define an algorithm from the view of a machine.
It receives some data (input).
It produces one or more results (output).
It performs comparison operations between data.
It creates memory and stores data to help find unknown values.
It performs mathematical or logical operations to solve the problem.


5.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Give a definition of an algorithm that includes:
exact language,
enough details,
order of steps,
and clearly shows it can finish (terminate).


An algorithm is a set of clear and ordered steps that solve a problem or perform a specific task. Each step is simple and understandable, and the algorithm has a start and an end, so it always finishes.

6.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explain why in writing algorithms we use ← (assignment) instead of =.
In writing algorithms, we use ← (assignment) instead of = because:
← clearly shows we are storing a value in a variable or memory location.
= is usually used for comparison (to check if two values are equal) in programming languages.

Using ← avoids confusion between assigning a value and checking equality.
It makes the algorithm easier to read and understand, because it clearly indicates that we are saving or updating a value, not comparing values.


7.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explain the difference between a human and a machine in how they think.
Humans:
Humans think creatively and flexibly.
They can understand emotions, context, and abstract ideas.
They learn from experience, make mistakes, and improve over time.
Human thinking is often slow but deep and adaptable.

Machines (Computers/AI):
Machines think logically and step by step.
They can only follow rules and instructions given by humans.
Machines cannot feel emotions or understand abstract ideas fully.
They are very fast and can process huge amounts of data, but only in the ways they are programmed.


8.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fully explain what is meant by the executor (performer) of an algorithm.
The executor (or performer) of an algorithm is a human, machine, or system that carries out the steps of the algorithm. 
An algorithm itself is just a set of instructions or rules to solve a problem, and it cannot do anything on its own. 
The executor is what actually performs these instructions.
For example, when we write an algorithm, we create step-by-step instructions to solve a problem, like solving a puzzle. 
The executor can be a human, a computer, or any device that can follow these instructions.
The executor must understand each step and follow every step exactly, without skipping any. Humans can act as executors, 
but they might make mistakes. Computers or machines can also be executors; they are usually fast and precise, but they can only follow the instructions that are given to them.
In short, the algorithm is the plan, and the executor is the doer of the plan.

9.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Define a counter in an algorithm executor and give an example.
Definition of a Counter in an Algorithm Executor:
A counter is a variable used by the executor (performer) of an algorithm to count how many times a step or action is performed. It is commonly used in loops to track repetitions and control when to stop.

Example Algorithm: Print numbers from 1 to n

1- start
2- get the n
3- i ← 1
4- i ← i+1
5- print i 
6- if i<=n go to line 4
7- end

Explanation:
Here, the counter i keeps track of how many numbers have been printed.
Each time the loop runs, i increases by 1.
The loop continues until i becomes greater than n.

Key Point:
A counter helps the executor repeat actions a specific number of times and ensures the algorithm stops correctly.

10.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write the meaning of each of the following expressions clearly:
a) 3 × 2 → p
Meaning:
Multiply 3 by 2.
Store the result in the variable p.

b) A → S
Meaning:
Take the value of variable A.
Store (assign) it into the variable S.

c) (2 - W) + T → T
Meaning:
Subtract the value of W from 2.
Add the value of T to the result.
Store the final result back into T.
