### What is a class?
Imagine you want to create many toy cars. Instead of making each car 
from scratch every time, you could first make a blueprint (a drawing or plan) of the car. 
Then, whenever you want a new car, you can just follow the blueprint to make one quickly.

A class in JavaScript is like that blueprint for objects. 
It tells the computer what a new object should look like and what it can do.

### How do we create a class?
To make a blueprint (class) in JavaScript, we use the word class. 
We give it a name, like "Car", and inside, we create a special part called the constructor. 
This constructor is like the part of the blueprint that tells the computer what the car’s name 
and year are.

### What does this do?
- name: What is the car called? (e.g., Ford, Audi)
- year: When was the car made? (e.g., 2014, 2019)

The constructor part helps the computer know these things whenever we make a new car.

### Making a new car
Now, we can make as many toy cars as we want using our blueprint! Here's how we make two cars:
let myCar1 = new Car("Ford", 2014);
let myCar2 = new Car("Audi", 2019);
Now we have two cars! One is called "Ford", made in 2014, and the other is "Audi", made in 2019.

### What are methods?
A method is like a tool your car can use. For example, 
if we want to know how old our car is, we can make a tool called age() 
that calculates it for us.

class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
  
  age() {
    let date = new Date();  // Gets the current year
    return date.getFullYear() - this.year;  // Subtracts the car’s year from the current year
  }
}
### How do we use this?
Now, we can ask our car how old it is by using the age() method.
let myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
console.log("My car is " + myCar.age() + " years old.");
This will tell us how old the car is by subtracting the car’s year from the current year.

### That’s it!

- Classes are blueprints for making objects (like toy cars).
- The constructor is where we tell the computer what each object needs (name and year).
- Methods are like tools that objects can use to do things (like figuring out the car’s age).
