### What is JSON?

- JSON (say it like "Jay-Son") is a way to store and share information, 
like a list of your toys.
- It's like writing down all your toy names and types in a very simple format 
that computers and people can both read.
- Even though JSON is written a little like JavaScript, 
it can be used by many different computer languages, not just JavaScript!

### How does it look?
Imagine you want to make a list of toys. 
Each toy has two parts: the name and the type of toy. 
Here’s how we would write that in JSON:

{
  "toys": [
    { "name": "Teddy Bear", "type": "Stuffed Animal" },
    { "name": "Lego Blocks", "type": "Building Toy" },
    { "name": "Toy Car", "type": "Vehicle" }
  ]
}
- Curly braces { } are like the box that holds all the information.
- Square brackets [ ] are like a list of items (in this case, toys).
- Colons : separate the name from its value, like “name”: “Teddy Bear.”
- Commas , are used to separate different toys or pieces of information.

### What are some rules?
- Names (like "name" and "type") must be in double quotes " " 
so everyone knows exactly what we’re talking about.
- Each piece of information is written in pairs: a name and a value. 
For example: "name": "Teddy Bear".

### JSON Objects
An object in JSON is like one complete toy. Here’s one toy:
{ "name": "Teddy Bear", "type": "Stuffed Animal" }
This is a JSON object because it has all the information about one toy. 

### JSON Arrays
An array in JSON is like a list of toys, 
not just one toy. So, an array would look like this:
[
  { "name": "Teddy Bear", "type": "Stuffed Animal" },
  { "name": "Lego Blocks", "type": "Building Toy" }
]
In this case, we have two toys in our list. 
Arrays are great when you have more than one item.

### How do we use JSON in JavaScript?
Let’s say you’ve written all your toys in JSON, like this:
{
  "toys": [
    { "name": "Teddy Bear", "type": "Stuffed Animal" },
    { "name": "Lego Blocks", "type": "Building Toy" },
    { "name": "Toy Car", "type": "Vehicle" }
  ]
}
Now, in JavaScript, you can turn this JSON text into something JavaScript 
can understand using a magic function called **JSON.parse()**.

Here’s how it works:
1. You write the JSON astringng** (a line of text):
  
   let text = '{ "toys": [' +
   '{ "name": "Teddy Bear", "type": "Stuffed Animal" },' +
   '{ "name": "Lego Blocks", "type": "Building Toy" },' +
   '{ "name": "Toy Car", "type": "Vehicle" } ]}';
   
2. Then, you tell JavaScriptparsese** this text (turn it into real JavaScript objects) using:
  
   const obj = JSON.parse(text);
   
3. Finally, you can use this information in your webpage. 
For example, if you want to show the name of the second toy, you can do this:
  
   document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = obj.toys[1].name;
   
   This will s"Lego Blocks"s"** because it’s the second toy in the list!

### SummaryJSONON** is a way to store and share information.
- It ucurly braceses** {} for objects (things) square bracketsts** [] for arrays (lists).
- You write everythingname/value pairsrs**, like "name": "Teddy Bear".
- You can easily turn JSON into JavaScript objects using **JSON.parse()**.

It’s like writing down all your toys in a way that anyone can read and understand, even computers!
